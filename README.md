# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program (Forage) 
## Skills - (Python, Data Cleaning, EDA, Visualizations)

This project was completed as part of the **Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program**, focusing on helping the **Category Manager for Chips** better understand customer behavior and sales performance. The core objective was to evaluate the **impact of a new in-store trial layout** and provide a data-driven recommendation on whether it should be rolled out across all stores.

**Key Analysis Areas:**

- Identifying and resolving **data quality issues** such as missing values, outliers, and misclassified items  
- Analyzing **total sales and purchase drivers** across product categories and customer segments  
- Comparing performance between **trial and control stores** to assess the effectiveness of the new layout  
- Making a **store-level recommendation** based on sales uplift and purchasing behavior
  
ðŸ› **Techniques & Tools Used:**

- **Data Validation & Cleaning:** Ensured consistent category labels and accurate numeric values across datasets  
- **Sales Metrics Definition:** Calculated key metrics such as total quantity sold, total revenue, and average spend  
- **Comparative Analysis:** Assessed performance uplift in trial stores vs control stores using quantitative evidence  
- **Recommendation Generation:** Provided actionable insights to support rollout decisions

**Libraries:**

- `Pandas` for structured data analysis  
- `NumPy` for mathematical operations  
- `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for visualization and comparative analysis

**Key Insights Discovered:**

- The **new trial layout** led to a **positive increase in overall sales**  
- Both **quantity sold and total revenue** were significantly higher in **trial stores** compared to control stores  
- Data supports a **recommendation to expand** the trial layout across more or all stores

**Skills Gained:**

- Hands-on experience with **real-world retail analytics problems**  
- Developed a **framework for testing store experiments** (trial vs control)  
- Strengthened ability to **translate data into business recommendations**  
- Applied critical thinking to validate data and interpret sales patterns  
- Enhanced fluency in using **Python for retail data analysis**
Certificate of Completion
